abstract: "The objective of this project was to develop and build a backup safety system for small
UAV. It consists of a parachute, a solid fuel rocket, a parachute and rocket container and
a simple activation electronic. In the case of an emergency or out of control situation
the UAV operator or an additional electronic device, which is not part of this work, can 
activate the system. After activation the following steps will take place: an electronic fuse
ignites and fires the rocket, which extracts a parachute packed in a parachute opening
device (POD), when line stretch is achieved the parachute leaves the POD and opens.
This activation method makes this parachute system suitable for slow flying drones such
as copters.
The container was designed in Catia V5 and manufactured by Fused Deposition
Modeling (FDM), the parachute was sewn. The electronic device demodulates a PWM
signal and activates the electronic fuse depending on the pulse width of the signal. Via
analytical formulae the drag force of the parachute was calculated.
The main aim was to develop and build a system, which increases the operation
safety for UAV of approximately 2kg takeoff weight. To validate this goal, in the final
project phase, a successful deployment with a quadrocopter was carried out."
