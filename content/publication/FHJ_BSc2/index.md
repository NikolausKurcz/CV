abstract: The canopy of a paraglider is suspended by a lot of suspension lines. To minimize
elongation, the latest available high tech fibers are used, commonly ultra high modulus
Polyethylene and Aramid. These materials have a very good creep and elastic stretch
resistance, but with the demand of more efficient wings the tolerances get smaller.
Therefore the exact characteristics of the line types start to gain significance in paraglider
development and manufacturing. On the one hand the elastic elongation has to be
considered, on the other the creep, which occurs over time in the highly loaded lines,
should be taken into account. As paragliders are exposed to all kinds of environmental
in
uences during use, these factors have to be considered as well. Lines with low load tend
to shrink over time when exposed to the environmental factors. To get an understanding
of the line characteristics, several tests were conducted. As a first step only elongation is
taken into account.
